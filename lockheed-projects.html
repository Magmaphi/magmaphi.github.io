  	<h3>C-130J Super Hercules</h3>
    <p>The Super Hercules is a multi-role fixed wing aircraft. A massive plane, it is adept at carrying almost anything, almost anywhere. The Super Hercules has had a remarkable amount of success, being used by 16 countries and having collectively flown for 1.2 million hours. The amount of use it has gotten however, is not surprising considering it's exceptional utility. It is capable of transporting over 18000 kilograms of cargo, able to operate out of 2,000 foot-long dirt strips in the mountains, and tough enough to fly into a hurricane. The amount of missions the Super Hercules can perform is just as varyed as the countries that operate it, with 16+ different missions types having been carried out by the plane. The most common of these operations include flying combat, humanitarian aid, special operations, aerial refueling, firefighting, and search and rescue missions. With a track record like that, there no reason the C-130J Super Hercules won't go into the history books.</p>
