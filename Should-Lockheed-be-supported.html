    <h2>The Pros of Lockheed Martin</h2>
	<p>Lockheed Martin Energy, is a divsion of Lockheed dedicated to researching better energy management. This is great for us as well as them as it is a hands on approach to reduce carbon emissions while they can sell their higher quality products. A mutual benefit like this is very sustainable since who doesn't like a win-win situation.</p>
    <p>Lockheed Martin have a lot of high quality products that have stood the test of time, protecting the free world for over a century. The former page was all about Lockheed products on the market today.  From the P-38 Lightning to the Aegis Missile Defence Lockheed Martin have never forgotten who they work for.</p>
      <p>When it comes to who they deal with, they aren't shady about it. Lockheed Martin only sell to the U.S.A or those America is allied with. There is nothing to suggest that they have any ties with unsavory organizations nor has any of their materiel ended up in enemy hands.</p>
    <p> Lockheed Martin are also leaders in space technology. They have launched over 100 commerial satellites and are still growing thier satellite tech. with the GOES-R. Lockheed also has plans for exploration of the solar system with vehicles like Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and Mars InSight. There is more that lockheed is doing..</p>
      <p>Lockheed Martin's dedication to science has pushed the limits of humanity's technology beyond killing people. Martin Energy as mentioned before, is creating a more sustainable world. Lockheed also invest in other technology such as advanced materials, nanotechnology, advanced robotics, and much more. This proves that Lockheed don't just make weapons.</p>

    <h2>The Cons of Lockheed Martin</h2>
  	<p>Lockheed Martin used the United States’ money to lobby the United States Government between 2008 and 2013 before being uncovered by a report conducted by Department of Energy’s inspector general and had to pay 4.7 million dollars. The money Lockheed Martin used was supposed to go to the Sandia nuclear laboratory however the money was instead used for lobbying. What they did violate their own value of doing what is right.</p>
    <p>Lockheed Martin have recently had problems with  the Littoral Combat Ship program (started 2004, problems 2015). The Littoral Combat Ship program had failures in  quality control resulting in major delays in production. Lockheed said that of the three L.C.B.s already produced, they have met or exceeded navy specifications. However, USS Milwaukee was damaged during preparation for a sea trial. </p>
      <p> F-35 Lightning II program  has also had problems (started 2006, problems 2014). The F-35 pragram is too ambitious, trying to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet, and AV-8B Harrier II. Since all three of these F-35 predecessors perform different roles and when the Lightning II is designed to fill all of them, it is resulting in an expensive mess that didn't do what it was supposed to.</p>
    <p>Lockheed Martin has a disturbing desire to form monopolys. We see this with Lockheed's F-35 program, trying to corner the fighter and attack aircraft market, however it runs deeper then that. Although all companies would love a monopoly, they are hardly as fierce as Lockheed Martin to get them and keep them. The one thorn in Lockheed Martin's side now is Space X, who broke Lockheed's and Boeing's oligopoly in the space military market. Over all, although Lockheed's products are pretty good, it is thier political skill that has put them on top. </p>
      <p>Lockheed spends too much on lobbying. In the year 2016 Lockheed Martin has spent 13.5 million dollars on lobbying, compared to Apple's 4.7 million dollars or microsoft's 8.7 million dollars. This  high lobbying budget is not surprising considering their customers are governments. However, this bad for the rest of us as it means less money spent on better products. But, Lockheed Martin can get away with it since they then have a monopoly. The one thorn in Lockheed Martin's side now is Space X, who broke Lockheed's and Boeing's oligopoly in the space military market. </p>

    <h2>Is Lockheed Martin Worth Supporting</h2>
        <p>Lockheed Martin is very complex company. They are masters of applied science and also of politics. This mastery has elevated them right to the top. They serve no one, even if they say they work for America. However, at the top of thier industry they can and are doing amazing things for science and in the defence of freedom. From what the data shows, it looks like there is no reason to worry. In a perfect world we could have better though in that world we wouldn't need anybody to defend us. If we were to be successful in removing Lockheed, some one worce would probably take thier place.</p>
